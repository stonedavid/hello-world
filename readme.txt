Sonnet 18:

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temparate
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
and Summer's lease has all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
and often is his gold complexion dimm'd,
and every fair from fair sometime declines,
by chance or Nature's changing course, untrimm'd.
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of the fair though ow'st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long lives this and this gives life to thee.

--By William Shakespeare
